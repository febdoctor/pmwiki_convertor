"""
Extract all versions from PmWiki page files.

This module parses all edits in PmWiki page files. From that, it computes
all versions of that page sorted by time.

Each version is a tuple of:

  * time in seconds since epoch (1970/1/1)
  * extracted version dict (all optional):
     * text: the PmWiki formatted text of that version
     * csum: change summary
     * author: who last modified the text in that version
     * filename: name of the page

Requirement:

  * Python3
  * WhatThePatch module
